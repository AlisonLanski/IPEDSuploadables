The goal of IPEDSuploadables is to allow institutions to upload their
data to IPEDS instead of manually typing numbers into screen after
screen of input. The package will produce text files in the key-value
format that meets IPEDS requirements for upload on their website.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AlisonLanski/IPEDSuploadables")
```
