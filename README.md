IPEDSuploadables produces text files in key-value format which meet the
IPEDS requirements for upload on their website. By using this package,
institutions can avoid the time and risk of manually typing numbers into
web forms across multiple screen. Package documentation (see the
[website](https://alisonlanski.github.io/IPEDSuploadables/)) describes
how an institutionâ€™s data must be formatted to make use of these
scripts.

### The package is currently serving the 2024-2025 IPEDS reporting cycle
