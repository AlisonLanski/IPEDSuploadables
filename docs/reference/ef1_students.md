# Dummy student data for Fall Enrollment scripts

Using the default number of students, this data provides a population
that touches most available categories of student reporting. Some
columns use only a selection of possible values to reduce complexity.

## Usage

``` r
ef1_students
```

## Format

A data frame with 100 rows and 25 columns

## Note

To recreate the saved dataframe exactly, use seed 1234 with 100
students.
