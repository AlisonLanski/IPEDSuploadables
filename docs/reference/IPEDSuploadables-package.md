# IPEDSuploadables: Transforms Institutional Data into Text Files for IPEDS Automated Import/Upload

Starting from user-supplied institutional data, these scripts transform,
aggregate, and reshape the information to produce key-value pair data
files that are able to be uploaded to IPEDS (Integrated Postsecondary
Education Data System) through their submission portal
<https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/>. Starting data specifications can
be found in the vignettes. Final files are saved locally to a location
of the user's choice. User-friendly readable files can also be produced
for purposes of data review and validation.
