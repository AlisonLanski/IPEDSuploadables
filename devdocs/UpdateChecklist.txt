Package update checklist

0) Is this a cycle update? Save off the prior year into a branch!!!!

1) Make updates in a branch
2) Pull request to dev
3) Pull request to master
3b) Update zzz.R file for load message (if necessary)

In master:
4) Run devtools::check and pkgdown::build_site
5) Increment version, update NEWS.md, and rerun check/build_site
6) Push commits

If doing a CRAN update (after updates, run normal things like document/check/pkgdown)
7) Run devtools::spell_check()
8) Run devtools::check_rhub() [takes about 45 minutes, see email or search for NOTE, WARNING, ERROR]
9) Run devtools::check_win_devel() [takes about 30 minutes, see email]
10) Update cran-comments.md
11) Push any final commits
12) Run devtools::release()
13) Repeat as needed....
14) After CRAN approval, add a tag to GitHub and release notes, wait for site to update

If just doing a github release
7) Add a tag and release notes, wait for github sites to update

To add a tag and do a GitHub release
A) Check existing tags
   git tag
B) Add a new tag to the head commit like this:
   git tag -a 2.8.5 -m "2023-2024 reporting cycle updates v2.8.5"
   where 2.8.5 is the version and "" is the tag message (in addition to the commit message)
   To tag a prior commit, just add the commit hash before -m
C) Check the log or run
   git show tag (version) to see the tag setup
D) Push to the server
   git push origin (version)
E) Open GitHub, go to releases, find the most recent related release, open it, click to edit, copy text
F) Create New Release with consistent title; correct tag, pasted and revised text
G) Preview/Edit until satisfied, then Publish
H) Can set as "prerelease" before Publish if doing this before it's actually on CRAN.
I) If H, then come back after it goes to CRAN, edit, and update to be a final release
J) Email "IPEDSuploadables Email list"
