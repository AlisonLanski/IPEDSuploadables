# Set up your data for IPEDS Admissions processing

## To use the `produce_adm_report` function, your student admissions data must be in the format described below

> - One row per person
> - One IPEDS Unitid per file
> - Columns with values and types as described below (additional columns
>   are allowed)

This population should meet IPEDS rules for inclusion on this report
(those seeking to be admitted to undergraduate programs as first-time
full-time degree/certificate seekers, including transfer students). This
data file is not necessary if your institution has an open-admissions
policy for entering first-time students.
